# mathjax-api

A Node.js HTTP API to render MathJax equations in HTML content.

This service uses the MathJax-node implementation that is optimised for mathjax embedded in HTML content. It is currently limited to Tex to SVG conversion.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

To run the API locally you must have the following:

1. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed:

   ```shell
   brew install nvm
   ```

   :warning: Make sure to follow the instructions provided at the end of the install to configure up your shell profile. Once you have done this, you will need to reload your shell for this to take effect.

2. The node version specified in [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) installed through nvm:

   ```shell
   nvm install
   ```

### Build and run

Once you have node installed, run the following to install the dependencies and run the server:

```shell
make debug
```

The API binds to port 8080, and is currently not configurable.

### Test the API is running

To test the API is running correctly:

1. Test the server is working by doing a HTTP GET or navigate to http://localhost:8080:

   ```shell
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

2. Test `POST`ing content to the service for conversion:

   ```shell
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data "input=$ Gamma(z) = int_0^infty t^{z-1} $" http://localhost:8080
   ```
